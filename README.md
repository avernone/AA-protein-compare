### Comparative analysis of amino acid composition and residue-specific ratios across UniProt protein sequences

---

## Overview

This web application, **fully developed in Python** and **deployed on Streamlit Cloud**, enables researchers to **compare the amino acid composition** and **specific residue ratios** (E/Q, E/P, Y/F, D/N, G/S) across multiple protein sequences retrieved from the [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) database.

The app provides:
- Quantitative **amino acid frequency tables** for each protein  
- Computed **residue ratio tables** for selected amino acid pairs  
- **Comparative bar plots** for visual inspection of amino acid distribution  
- A downloadable **Excel file** including all tables and plots  

In this Lab, the effect of amino acid availability as regulating factor of every protein synthesis is investigated
